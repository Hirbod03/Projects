## Flappy Bird in Java
This is a Flappy Bird game implemented in Java using the Swing GUI toolkit. The game is based on the popular mobile game where the player controls a bird and must navigate it through a series of pipes without hitting them.

### Features
The bird can be controlled using the spacebar to flap its wings and gain altitude.
Pipes are generated randomly at different heights and speeds to create a challenging gameplay experience.
The game keeps track of the player's score based on how many pipes they successfully navigate through.
The game has a game over screen that displays the player's final score and allows them to restart the game.

### Requirements
Java 8 or later
A Java IDE such as Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA
