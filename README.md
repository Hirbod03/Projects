# Projects
A repo storing my projects.

These include both personal and course projects.

The purpose of this repo is demonstrate a small portion of my programming experience. 

Furthermore, code in this repo that satifies programming assignments in cs courses at UWO should serve educators in catching those who are plagirizing.

I do not take any responsibility in plagirism that involves code from this repo, as it is public and it has been submitted to UWO cs professors prior to being uploaded here.

Thanks for reading.
