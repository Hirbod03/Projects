## Projects
A repo storing some of my projects.

These include both personal projects and univeristy course assignments.

The purpose of this repo is demonstrate a small portion of my programming experience. 

Furthermore, code in this repo that satifies programming assignments in cs courses at UWO should serve educators in catching those who are plagirizing.

I do not take any responsibility in plagirism that involves code from this repo, as it is public and it has been submitted to UWO cs professors prior to being uploaded here.
