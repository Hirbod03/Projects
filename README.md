## Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I store some of my personal programming projects! This repository contains a variety of projects, including a URL shortener and a password generator, as well as a Flappy Bird game and a World Cup database developed in C.

The URL shortener is a Python program that allows the user to shorten long URLs into shorter and more manageable links. This program uses a unique algorithm to create the shortened URLs, making them difficult to guess. The password generator is another Python program that generates strong and secure passwords using a random combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.

The Flappy Bird game is a classic and addictive game where the player controls a bird and must navigate through obstacles by flapping its wings. My version of the game features a simple and user-friendly interface.

The World Cup database is a C program that acts as a database for storing World Cup team information, including team numbers, seeding, name, and kit color. The user can add and modify teams and their information as needed.

These projects demonstrate my ability to develop functional and efficient applications using different programming languages. I welcome any feedback and suggestions on how to improve my projects. Thank you for visiting my repository!
