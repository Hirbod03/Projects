## Projects
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I store two of my personal programming projects! This repository contains a Flappy Bird game built in Java and a World Cup database developed in C.

The Flappy Bird game is a classic and addictive game where the player controls a bird and must navigate through obstacles by flapping its wings. My version of the game features a simple and user-friendly interface.

The World Cup database is program that acts as a database to store info regarding teams participating in the world cup.

Both of these projects demonstrate my ability to develop efficient, functional, and fun applications. They also showcase my proficiency in Java and C programming languages.

Feel free to explore my repository, clone any of the projects, and make modifications as needed. I welcome any feedback and suggestions on how to improve my projects. Thank you for visiting my repo!
