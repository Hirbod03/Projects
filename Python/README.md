# passGen
As part of my personal coding projects, I started with a basic password generator in Python using built-in libraries such as random and string. This project allows users to generate a random password of any length, with a combination of letters, digits, and special characters.

The user is prompted to enter the desired password length, and the script generates a random string by selecting characters randomly from a set of possible characters. The generated password is then returned to the user.

This project demonstrates my ability to utilize Python libraries, handle user input, and create simple programs with practical applications. I enjoyed working on this project and may continue to improve and expand upon it in the future.As part of my personal coding projects, I started with

# urlShortne
A simple URL shortener program in Python that generates a shortened version of the input URL using a hash function. The shortened URL is unique and can be used to redirect to the original URL.

The program utilizes the string, random, and hashlib libraries in Python. The input URL is passed through the hash() function, which converts the URL to bytes and creates an MD5 hash of the bytes. The generated hash is used as the key in a dictionary to store the original URL and its shortened version.

The shortener() function first checks if the URL has already been shortened by checking if the hash exists in the dictionary. If it does, the previously generated shortened URL is returned. If not, a new shortened URL is generated using the urlGenerator() function, which creates a random six-character string.

This project demonstrates my proficiency in Python programming, handling user input, and working with built-in libraries. I am excited to continue developing this project and explore more advanced techniques for URL shortening and redirection, more complex databases and ways of encryption.
